 * Given a list of points on the 2-D plane and an integer K. The task is to find K closest points to the origin and print them.
 *
 * Note: The distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.The euclidean distance between these two points will be:
 * âˆš{(x2-x1)2 + (y2-y1)2}
 *
 * Input : point = [[3, 3], [5, -1], [-2, 4]], K = 2
 * Output : [[3, 3], [-2, 4]]
 * Explanation:
 * Square of Distance of origin from this point is
 * (3, 3) = 18
 * (5, -1) = 26
 * (-2, 4) = 20
 * So rhe closest two points are [3, 3], [-2, 4].
 *
 * Input : point = [[1, 3], [-2, 2]], K  = 1
 * Output : [[-2, 2]]
 * Explanation:
 * Square of Distance of origin from this point is
 * (1, 3) = 10
 * (-2, 2) = 8
 * So the closest point to origin is (-2, 2)
 *
 * We need to find the k closest points. The best way to achieve this would be to use PriorityQueue.
 * It would give us K closest distance. But we need a mapping between distance and the point. This mapping can be used by using HashMap.
